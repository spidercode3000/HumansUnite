	<h1>What Do We Do?</h1><br>
	<p>We at HumansUnite , work for well-being of all of humanity. No nation should discriminate humans based upon just anything. We believe that no religion should exist if it costs the lives of innocent humans and put their trusts on stake for each other.We work so that people can understand that there are bigger threats than themselves in this universe.
		<pre>			Magnetars.
			Star Quakes.
			High CO<sub>2</sub> emmisions.
		</pre></p><br>
		<p>We strongly believe that no human should just be in lack of benefits just because. . . . . . He was born in a poor country.This website is made to encourage people to be the part of the change. Now or then , there will be a problem coming to us humans. It came many times , but we survived luck by chance. </p><br>
		<p>Stop Military.</p><br>
		<p>We are fighting this. But  don't think 15,000 people will be enough.</p>
